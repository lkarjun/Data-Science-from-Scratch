## Deep Learning.
    
    # The Neuron
    
        inputs ===> Neuron ===> Output signal
    
    * Deep Learing uses more more Hidden Neurons
 
    * Updating weights with optimizers through backpropogation.
    * finding best learning rate by hyper parameter tuninig
    
    
        
        
        
    # Vanishing Gradient 
    
        * Derivative of sigmoide will be specifically between 0 to 0.25
